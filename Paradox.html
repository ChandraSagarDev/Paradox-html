    <h2>The Cat Experiment</h2>
    <p>The cat experiment theory, known as Schrödinger's cat, suggests that a cat in a closed box can be both alive and
        dead at the same time until observed, highlighting the strange nature of quantum mechanics..</p>

    <h3>Experiment</h3>
    <p>In the experiment, a hypothetical cat is placed in a closed box along with a vial of poison that could be
        released by a random quantum event. The quantum event is triggered by the decay of a radioactive atom.</p>

    <p>According to quantum mechanics, before the box is opened and the cat observed, the cat exists in a superposition
        of two states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alive</li>
        <li>Dead</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This means that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time, in a probabilistic sense.</p>
</div>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>The paradox arises because in classical physics, we would expect the cat to be either alive or dead, not both. It is
    only when the box is opened and the cat is observed that the wave function collapses, and the cat is found to be
    either alive or dead.</p>

<p> It highlights the strange and counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics, where particles can exist in multiple
    states simultaneously until observed or measured.</p>

<h3>Erwin Schrödinger</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrodinger</a>, was a Nobel Prize-winning
    Austrian and naturalized Irish physicist who developed fundamental results in quantum theory. This experiment was
    proposed by Schrödinger in 1935 to illustrate the strange principles of quantum superposition and the collapse of
    the wave function.</p>
